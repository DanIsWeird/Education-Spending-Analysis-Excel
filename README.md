# Education-Spending-Analysis-Excel
This project analyzes global education data from 1999–2023 to examine how government spending on education and pupil–teacher ratios relate to school enrollment rates at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel as part of a Data Science coursework project, with a focus on exploratory data analysis and interpretation rather than predictive modeling.

Research Questions:
  How does government education spending (% of GDP) relate to school enrollment?
  Do enrollment outcomes differ across primary, secondary, and tertiary education levels?
  How do pupil–teacher ratios relate to enrollment rates?
  Which countries show the highest enrollment rates and the most improvement over time?

Dataset:
  The dataset includes international education indicators such as:
  Government expenditure on education (% of GDP)
  Literacy rates (ages 15+)
  Primary, secondary, and tertiary enrollment rates
  Pupil–teacher ratios
  Completion rates
  Data spans 1999–2023 and includes missing values and country-level variation that required cleaning and interpretation.

Data Cleaning & Feature Construction
  Key preprocessing steps included:
    Dropping unnecessary or redundant variables
    Handling missing values
    Aggregating metrics across years and countries
    Constructing new features such as:
    Spending per student
    Enrollment disparity between primary and secondary education
    Year-over-year enrollment growth metrics
    All preprocessing and analysis were performed directly in Excel using formulas, pivot tables, and charts.

Key Findings
  Primary education shows a positive relationship between spending and enrollment, but with diminishing returns beyond ~6% of GDP.
  Secondary and tertiary enrollment shows weaker or inconsistent relationships with spending, suggesting stronger influence from socio-economic and structural factors.
  Pupil–teacher ratios have mixed effects depending on education level.
  Several countries appear as outliers, reflecting unique policy choices or demographic conditions.
